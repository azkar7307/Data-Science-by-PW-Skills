    "The PMF gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. For example, if we toss a fair coin twice, we can define a random variable X that counts the number of heads that appear. X can take on the values 0, 1, or 2. The PMF of X gives the probability of each possible value of X. In this case, the PMF is:\n",

    "2. The sum of the probabilities over all possible values of X equals 1: $ ΣP(X=x) = 1 $ \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the PDF gives the probability density of a continuous random variable at each possible value. For example, the height of a person is a continuous random variable. The PDF of the height variable gives the probability density at each height value. The PDF of a continuous random variable satisfies the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For any value x, the PDF gives a non-negative value: $ f(x) ≥ 0 $\n",
    "2. The area under the PDF curve over a given range gives the probability of the variable falling within that range: $ P(a ≤ X ≤ b) = ∫a^b f(x) dx $\n",
    "3. The total area under the PDF curve is equal to 1: $ ∫-∞^∞ f(x) dx = 1 $\n",
