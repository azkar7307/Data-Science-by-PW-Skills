    "The key difference between a t-test and a z-test is the knowledge of population variance. A z-test assumes that the population variance is known, whereas a t-test assumes that the population variance is unknown and estimates it from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-test is typically used when the sample size is large (typically above 30) and the population standard deviation is known. For example, a researcher wants to know if the mean IQ of a particular population is different from 100. The researcher can use a z-test if the standard deviation of the population is known and a sample of sufficient size is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically below 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown. For example, a researcher wants to know if a new medication is effective in reducing cholesterol levels in patients. The researcher can use a t-test to compare the mean cholesterol levels of a treatment group and a control group, where the population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample size is relatively small.\n",

    "In hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors that can occur: Type 1 and Type 2 errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Type 1 Error`**: A Type 1 error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis. In other words, it occurs when a hypothesis test indicates that there is a significant difference between two groups or variables, but in reality, there is no difference. This error is also known as a false positive. The probability of making a Type 1 error is denoted by the Greek letter alpha (α), and it is usually set at 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "*`Example scenario`*: Suppose a medical researcher is conducting a clinical trial to test the effectiveness of a new drug. The null hypothesis is that the drug has no effect on the patients, while the alternative hypothesis is that the drug has a significant effect. A Type 1 error occurs if the researcher concludes that the drug is effective when it is actually not.\n",

    "**`Type 2 Error`**: A Type 2 error is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. In other words, it occurs when a hypothesis test fails to detect a significant difference between two groups or variables, but in reality, there is a difference. This error is also known as a false negative. The probability of making a Type 2 error is denoted by the Greek letter beta (β).\n",

    "*`Example scenario`*: Suppose a manufacturing company produces a certain type of product with a specific weight. The null hypothesis is that the mean weight of the product is equal to a certain value, while the alternative hypothesis is that the mean weight is different. A Type 2 error occurs if the company fails to detect a significant difference in the mean weight of the product, even though the actual weight is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a Type 1 error occurs when we reject a true null hypothesis, while a Type 2 error occurs when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis. It is important to consider both types of errors when conducting hypothesis testing, as they can have significant consequences depending on the context of the study."

    "Bayes's theorem is a statistical theorem that describes the probability of an event occurring based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It is named after the 18th-century English statistician Thomas Bayes.\n",

    "Bayes's theorem is useful in many fields, including medicine, genetics, and engineering. For example, suppose there is a disease that affects 1% of the population. A medical test is developed to detect the disease, but it is not perfect: it correctly identifies the disease in 95% of cases and produces a false positive result in 2% of cases (i.e., it indicates the presence of the disease when it is not actually present).\n",
