    "## Answer:\n",
    "Class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behavior of objects of a specific type. In object-oriented programming (OOP), classes define how objects are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class that has its own properties and behavior. An object is an instance of a class, and objects of the same class have similar attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a class called \"Car\". A Car class has properties such as make, model, year, and color, and behaviors such as start, stop, and accelerate. Each car object created from the Car class will have its own unique set of properties, but they will all share the same behavior defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could create two car objects: a Honda Civic and a Toyota Camry, both of which are instances of the Car class. The Honda Civic object might have make=\"Honda\", model=\"Civic\", year=2020, and color=\"red\". The Toyota Camry object might have make=\"Toyota\", model=\"Camry\", year=2021, and color=\"blue\"."

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class from other objects. This allows for a clean separation of concerns, where objects only interact with each other through a well-defined interface, making it easier to maintain the code and reduce the risk of unintended side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of exposing only the necessary information about an object to other objects, while hiding the implementation details. This allows developers to work with objects in a more intuitive and user-friendly way, making the code easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be created from an existing class. The new class (known as the subclass or derived class) inherits the properties and behavior of the existing class (known as the superclass or base class), making it easier to reuse existing code and reduce the amount of duplicated code in a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. This allows objects to be treated as objects of the same type, even if they are instances of different classes. This allows for greater flexibility in code, making it easier to write generic code that can work with objects of different types."
