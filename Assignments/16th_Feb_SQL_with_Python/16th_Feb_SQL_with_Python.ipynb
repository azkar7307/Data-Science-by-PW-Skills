    "A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is an essential component of most modern software applications and is used to store various types of data such as customer information, financial records, and product inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two types of database management systems that differ in their approach to data storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas. They use SQL as a standard language for managing data and querying the database. SQL databases are known for their robustness, scalability, and consistency in data management. Some popular examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not use tables to store data. Instead, they use document-based, key-value, or graph-based data models. NoSQL databases are more flexible and can handle unstructured data more efficiently than SQL databases. They are also highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data. Some popular examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are best suited for applications that require structured data, consistency, and reliability. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are ideal for applications that handle unstructured data, need high scalability, and have evolving data requirements."

    "**`Primary Key`**:\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. It is used to ensure that each row in a table is unique and can be easily referenced by other tables in the database. Primary keys can be created using one or more columns in a table, and they must be unique and not null. A table can have only one primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a \"customers\" table, the customer_id column could be used as the primary key. This ensures that each customer has a unique identifier and allows other tables to reference the customer by their ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`Foreign Key`**:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables in a database. The table that contains the foreign key is called the child table, and the table that contains the primary key is called the parent table.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in an \"orders\" table, the customer_id column could be used as a foreign key that refers to the customer_id primary key in the \"customers\" table. This ensures that each order is associated with a specific customer and allows the orders to be easily retrieved for a specific customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign keys can be used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that data in the child table is consistent with the data in the parent table. This means that if a row in the parent table is deleted or updated, the corresponding rows in the child table will also be updated or deleted, ensuring that the data remains consistent.\n",
