    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program. When an exception occurs, Python generates an exception object that contains information about the error, including the type of the exception and the location in the program where it occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter encounters an invalid statement or expression that violates the language's rules of syntax. Unlike exceptions, syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed, and they prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between an exception and a syntax error is that a syntax error occurs before the program is executed, while an exception occurs during the execution of the program. Exceptions can be raised intentionally by the programmer or can be caused by unforeseen circumstances, such as an input that the program cannot handle or a file that cannot be opened. In contrast, syntax errors are always caused by invalid code that violates the rules of the Python language."

    "In Python, custom exceptions are exceptions that are defined by the programmer to represent specific error conditions that can occur in their code. Custom exceptions are created by inheriting from the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses, and can be raised and handled in the same way as built-in exceptions.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Clarity**: Custom exceptions can provide more clarity about the specific error condition that occurred, and can make it easier to understand and debug the code.\n",

    "**Modularity**: Custom exceptions can make the code more modular by separating the error handling logic from the rest of the code.\n",
